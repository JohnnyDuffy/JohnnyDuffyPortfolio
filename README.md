Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio!

I am a python programmer interested in finance and crypto. 

At the moment, my portfolio contains six projects. four data analysis projects, and two simple bitcoin trading bots.
I am currently learning more about algorithmic trading, and will tackle machine learning after that. I will continue to add to this portfolio as time goes on.

Thank you for you time, and please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions!
