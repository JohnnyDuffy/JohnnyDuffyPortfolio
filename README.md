Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio!

I am a self taught python programmer interested in finance and crypto. 

At the moment, my portfolio contains three projects, focusing on data analysis.
I am currently learning algorthmic trading and machine learning, and will continue to add to this portfolio as time goes on.

Thank you for you time, and please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions!
All the best,

Johnny
