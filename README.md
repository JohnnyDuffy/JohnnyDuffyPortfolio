Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio!

I am a self taught python programmer, interested in finance and crypto. 

At the moment, my portfolio contains three projects, focusing on data analysis.
I am currently learning algorthmic trading and machine learning, and will update soon!

Thanks again!

Johnny
